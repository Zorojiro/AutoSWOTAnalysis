Begin by listing your strengths, considering your natural talents, skills, achievements, and resources. Reflect on questions such as what you are naturally good at, what advantages you have over others, and what achievements set you apart from your colleagues. Next, identify your weaknesses by acknowledging areas where you need improvement, bad habits, and skills that require development. Ask yourself about your negative traits, areas where your education or training may be lacking, and situations where you lack confidence. Then, explore opportunities for growth within your industry, company, and desired career path by considering the state of your industry, emerging technologies, and the potential support from your professional network. Finally, address potential threats to your career goals, such as external factors like industry changes, economic conditions, and competition, as well as internal challenges like bad habits and skill deficiencies. Use this SWOT analysis to identify goals, devise strategies, and create action plans for advancing your career, ensuring an honest and balanced assessment to stay motivated and effective. An example of a personal SWOT analysis might include strengths like being a creative thinker, working well under pressure, having an advanced degree, being organized and personable, being resourceful, and asking good questions. Weaknesses might include procrastination, tardiness, past issues with coworkers, less experience with AI technology, shyness in meetings, and presentation anxiety. Opportunities might involve proposing new market strategies, utilizing AI tools, seeking advice from mentors, taking online courses, and working with a career coach. Threats could include the need for more education, slower project completion compared to peers, being viewed as unreliable due to bad habits, potential job obsolescence due to AI advancements, and increasing competition from new talent. Use this SWOT analysis to brainstorm goals and strategize action plans for career advancement, ensuring an honest and balanced approach to create an effective and motivating assessment.\"\"\",\n","    allow_delegation = False,\n",")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":12,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["FORMATTER = Agent(\n","    role = \"chatbot response formatter\",\n","    goal = \"you have to carefully format the response to the four quadrants of SWOT analysis\",\n","    backstory=\"You are very good at formatting the text data and you have to format the response to the four quadrants of SWOT analysis. try make response more like human.\",\n","    allow_delegation = False,\n",")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":13,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["SWOT_analysis = Task(\n","    description = f\"\"\"Create a SWOT analysis for a student using the provided detailed information.
